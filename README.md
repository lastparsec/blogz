        <p>As an independent service provider (ISP) for FedEx Ground, the success of your company depends on how efficiently drivers are able to complete their routes. Utilizing a routing app is crucial to optimizing driver routes. Let's take a look at the importance of routing apps and how Beans Route can help take your company to the next level.</p>
<h2>What are Routing Apps? </h2>
<p>Routing apps are designed to allow delivery service companies to create and optimize the most efficient routes for drivers to complete multiple deliveries. According to regulation, each ISP must have at least 5 routes or 500 deliveries, which means that drivers need a way to plan routes that allow them to stay on schedule.  </p>
<h2>The Benefits of Routing Apps</h2>
<p>Routing apps offer several benefits for ISP FedEx Ground companies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to enter multiple delivery addresses</li>
<li>Allows you to input every delivery address and then automatically configures the best route</li>
<li>Takes into account factors such as traffic, weather, and road work to provide an accurate estimated time of arrival to each destination</li>
<li>Saves company time and labor costs by increasing efficiency</li>
<li>Lessens the wear and tear on delivery vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike traditional navigation apps that are only designed to take you from point A to point B, routing apps are specially designed to accommodate multiple delivery points.</p>
<h2>How Beans Route Maximizes Profit of Your ISP for FedEx Ground</h2>
<p>Beans Route is an innovative pickup and delivery platform that integrates seamlessly with FedEx Ground. This comprehensive routing app reduces time and mileage by more than 20% when compared to other traditional routing apps. Here are the features Bean Route offers FedEx Ground ISPs. </p>
<h3><em>Increase Number of Stops Per Hour</em></h3>
<p>Beans Route gives exact directions right to the front doors, including apartments. The app also gives the best parking options, as well as apartment and neighborhood entrance locations so that drivers do not have to waste valuable time searching for parking and entrances. Easily receive codes for delivery locker locations. The ability for drivers to find their delivery destinations much faster means increased efficiency and more deliveries made per hour which increases profits.</p>
<h3><em>Reduce Cost per Delivery</em></h3>
<p>Beans Route gives you the ability to efficiently manage any size delivery team by balancing workloads. The innovative platform allows you to enter multiple delivery locations (3-300) in any order that you wish. The routing app then automatically assesses which route will be the shortest, fastest, and most efficient for each driver. This reduces the number of miles driven, cost per mile, and the overall cost per delivery. </p>
<h3><em>Know Exactly Where to Leave Packages</em></h3>
<p>Custom pins and notes allow drivers to quickly reference policies and know exactly where to leave each package for exceptional customer service. This also includes special directions for packages.</p>

<h2>Tested First Hand</h2>
<p>The issue with most routing apps is that they are designed by someone in a meeting room. Beans Route was developed in trucks. We had developers run routes and deliver packages to understand every single pain point for drivers, managers, and owners. We then created a routing app that addressed all of these pain points. <a href="https://www.beansroute.ai/3pl-console" target="_blank">Try Beans Route for FREE</a> and see the difference it makes in your ISP FedEx Ground company.</p>
